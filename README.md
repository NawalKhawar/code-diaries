# Code Diaries üçÑüåø 

Welcome to **Code Diaries**, a place where I document my coding journey as a Computer Science student! üçÑüåø

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About 
I'm on a mission to sharpen my programming skills beyond just coursework. This repository will contain small projects, coding exercises, and explorations into different programming concepts as I build confidence in writing code.

## üìå Progress Log 
| Day  | Project | Description | Concepts Practiced | Language | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|--------------------|----------|-------|
| 1    | Simple Calculator | A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using user input.| Conditional Statements (`if-else`), Loops (`while`, `do-while`), Functions (for modularity) | C++, Python | Day 1 down! This project felt far too silly, since it's so simple, but we gotta start somewhere, right?|
| 2    | Number Guessing Game | A simple game where the user has to guess a secret, randomly generated number. Also includes a basic hint system, and displays number of guesses made/hints used at the end. | Conditional Statements (`if-else`), Loops (`while`), Functions (for modularity), Data type conversions, Random number generation (using Python's `random` module), Checking if a given number is prime, Digit extraction | Python | Finally done with Day 2! Been procrastinating on this one for a while. I learned how to use Python's `random` module for the first time. I also spent a lot of time working on the hints system - deciding how many hints to keep and what information to reveal in what order, so the game remains challenging enough without becoming frustrating. Overall this program was fun to write!|
