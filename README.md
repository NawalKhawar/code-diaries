# Code Diaries 🍄🌿 

Welcome to **Code Diaries**, a place where I document my coding journey as a Computer Science student! 🍄🌿

## ℹ️ About 
I'm on a mission to sharpen my programming skills beyond just coursework. This repository will contain small projects, coding exercises, and explorations into different programming concepts as I build confidence in writing code.

## 📌 Progress Log 
| Day  | Project | Description | Concepts Practiced | Language | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|--------------------|----------|-------|
| 1    | Simple Calculator | A basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using user input.| Conditional Statements (`if-else`), Loops (`while`, `do-while`), Functions (for modularity) | C++, Python | Day 1 down! This project felt far too silly, since it's so simple, but we gotta start somewhere, right?|
| 2    | Number Guessing Game | A simple game that generate a random number between 1 and 1000, and the user has to guess what said number is. Also includes a basic hint system, and displays number of guesses made at the end. | Conditional Statements (`if-else`), Loops (`while`, `do-while`), Functions (for modularity), Random number generation (using Python's `random` module) | Python | Finally done with Day 2! Been procrastinating on this one for a while. I learned how to use Python's `random` module for the first time. This was fun to make!|
